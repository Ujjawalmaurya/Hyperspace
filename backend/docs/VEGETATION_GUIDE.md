# Vegetation Analysis Guide

This guide explains the various vegetation indices generated by our analysis pipeline and how to interpret the AI-driven insights.

## Vegetation Indices

### 1. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- **What it is**: The industry standard for measuring plant health and density.
- **Formula**: `(NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)`
- **Range**: -1.0 to 1.0
- **Interpretation**:
    - **> 0.7**: Dense, healthy vegetation (Green).
    - **0.4 - 0.7**: Moderate health, early stage crops (Yellow).
    - **< 0.3**: Bare soil, water, or stressed vegetation (Red).
- **Use Case**: General monitoring of crop vigor and biomass.

### 2. GNDVI (Green NDVI)
- **What it is**: Similar to NDVI but uses the Green band instead of Red.
- **Use Case**: More sensitive to chlorophyll content than NDVI. useful for detecting **Nitrogen deficiency** or early signs of senescence effectively even when the canopy is dense.

### 3. NDRE (Normalized Difference Red Edge)
- **What it is**: Uses the Red Edge band, which penetrates deeper into the canopy.
- **Use Case**: Critical for **late-stage crops** or dense canopies where NDVI saturates (stops showing differences). Good for permanent crops like orchards.

### 4. SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- **What it is**: NDVI adjusted with a correction factor (L) for soil brightness.
- **Use Case**: Best for **young crops** or areas with sparse vegetation where soil background noise distorts NDVI.

### 5. OSAVI (Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- **What it is**: A further optimization of SAVI.
- **Use Case**: Provides better separation between soil and vegetation in variable conditions.

## AI Dashboard Data

Our system uses Gemini AI to analyze the statistical distribution of all the above indices to provide:

- **Health Score**: A composite score (0-100) reflecting the overall condition of the field.
- **Focus Areas**: Specific zones (e.g., "North-East corner") identified as having high variance or stress signals.
- **Recommendations**: Actionable agronomic advice based on the specific combination of index values (e.g., "Apply Nitrogen" if GNDVI is low but NDVI is high).
