## ✨ Key Features
- **AI Analysis Command Center**: Upload drone imagery for real-time AI processing.
- **Interactive GIS Maps**: Visualize multispectral and health layers via a simulated GIS engine.
- **Disease Detection**: Automated anomaly detection using YOLOv8 models.
- **Health Indicators**: Real-time NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) calculations.
- **Multilingual Support**: Fully localized interface in English and Hindi.
- **Team Management**: Role-based access control for farm staff.
- **Fleet Connectivity**: Integrated drone hardware status and management.

## 🛠️ Manual Setup

If you prefer to run services manually without Docker:

### 1. Backend
1. Go to `backend/`.
2. Install: `npm install`.
3. Configure `.env` (use `.env.example` as a template).
4. Run: `npm run dev`.

### 2. ML Service
1. Go to `ml_service/`.
2. Setup venv: `python -m venv venv` and activate it.
3. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run: `python main.py`.
*(Note: Use Docker if your Python version is > 3.12 to avoid build issues)*

### 3. Frontend
1. Go to `frontend/`.
2. Install: `npm install`.
3. Run: `npm run dev`.

## 🎨 Running Frontend Alone (Standalone)

If you only want the UI with mock data:
1. Go to `frontend/`.
2. Run: `npm run standalone`.

## 🚁 Drone Connectivity
To connect a drone:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** in the dashboard.
2. Click **Connect** on the DJI or Satellite Hub option.
3. Access the **Launch Analysis** command center in the Navbar to begin uploading flight imagery.
